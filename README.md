### Approach

**My Coding Approach:**

I will follow an iterative and incremental approach, dividing the project into sprints to ensure efficient development and timely delivery of features. Utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I will focus on building a robust video conferencing application.

**Sprint 1:**
In the first sprint, my focus will be on establishing the basic functionalities of the application:

- **Connect Two People:** Implement the core functionality to establish a video/audio connection between two users.
- **Toggle Audio/Video:** Provide options to toggle audio and video during the call.
- **Leave Call:** Implement the functionality to end the call gracefully.
- **Copy Link:** Enable users to easily copy the call link to share with others.

**Sprint 2:**
In the second sprint, I will expand the application's capabilities:

- **Connect More Than 2 People:** Enhance the video conferencing feature to support multiple participants. (Dev mode)
- **Authentication:** Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
- **UI Design:** Focus on designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Send Mail:** Integrate functionality to send email notifications for various events, such as meeting invitations.

**Sprint 3:**
For the third sprint, I will introduce additional features to enrich the user experience:

- **Chat Box:** Implement a chat box feature to allow users to exchange text messages during the call.
- **Raise Hand:** Integrate a "raise hand" feature to facilitate communication and participation during group calls.
- **Video Duration:** Display the duration of the ongoing video call for better time management.
- **Notification Messages and Error Alerts:** Implement notification messages and error alerts to keep users informed about important events and handle errors gracefully.

**Sprint 4:**
In the fourth sprint, I will focus on enhancing communication and collaboration:

- **Chat Box Messages:** Further develop the chat box functionality to support multimedia messages and file sharing.
- **Team Chat Feature:** Introduce a team chat feature to enable participants to communicate outside of video calls, fostering collaboration and teamwork.

Throughout the development process, I will prioritize regular communication with stakeholders, conduct thorough testing at each stage, and iterate based on feedback to ensure the final product meets the requirements and exceeds expectations.
